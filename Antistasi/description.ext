Scavenge to succeed.<br/>- highly performant: reported +200 AIs with 5 players.<br/>- supports ACE, CUPS, RHS, VCOM.<br/><br/>Meta discussion: this is a fork of Antistasi whose code was greatly optimized, improved and simplified to be easily ported to different mods (e.g. RHS, CUPS), maps (Altis, Tanoa), missions, etc.<br/>See more details at <a href='https://github.com/LordGolias/antistasi'>Github</a>";
